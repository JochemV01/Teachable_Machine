# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Teachable Machine Tutorial

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is a tutorial about how to make Teachable Machine work in your own webpage
  with a file-upload instead of the webcame. I did not find how to do this anywhere
  on the internet, so I had to figure it out on my own. Hopefully this is helpful
  to you!
#baseurl: "/Teachable_Machine" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
#url: "https://jochemv01.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
url: "https://teachable-machine.jjochem.nl"
